# Jumper Project Context

This skill provides essential context about the Jumper 2D platformer project to ensure Claude understands the codebase architecture, conventions, and systems before making any changes.

## Project Overview

**Project**: Jumper (JumperPOC)
**Engine**: Unity 6000.2.0b9
**Type**: 2D Platformer
**Location**: X:/GameDev/Jumper/JumperPOC

## Core Architecture

### Key Systems

1. **Player System** (`Assets/Scripts/Player/`)
   - `PlayerController.cs` - Main movement, jumping, dashing (1,848 LOC - large, complex)
   - `PlayerCombat.cs` - Attack system, combos, hitboxes
   - `PlayerAbilities.cs` - Ability unlocking system (dash, double jump, wall stick)
   
2. **Enemy System** (`Assets/Scripts/Enemies/`)
   - `SimpleEnemy.cs` - Base enemy behavior
   - `HeadStompTriggerHandler.cs` - Head stomp mechanics
   - `Enemy1Hitbox.cs` - Enemy collision handling
   - Uses interface `IEnemyBase` for enemy contracts

3. **Level Management**
   - `LevelTransitionManager.cs` - Scene transitions
   - `SimpleRespawnManager.cs` - Death and respawn handling
   - `SavePoint.cs` - Checkpoint system

4. **Environment**
   - `BreakableTerrain.cs` - Destructible terrain blocks
   - `BreakableTerrainManager.cs` - Terrain management
   - `CustomCompositeColliderGenerator.cs` - Tilemap collision optimization

### Architecture Patterns Used

**Singleton Pattern**: 
- `PlayerController`, `SimpleRespawnManager`, `PlayerAbilities`
- Uses `DontDestroyOnLoad()` for persistence

**Event System**:
- C# events and delegates for component communication
- Example: Health changes, combat events, landing events

**Component-Based**:
- Separates concerns (PlayerController, PlayerCombat, PlayerAbilities)
- Components require each other via `[RequireComponent]`

**Ability System**:
- `PlayerAbilities` manages unlockable features
- Systems check abilities before execution (e.g., wall stick, double jump)

## Important Conventions

### Code Style

**Naming**:
- Private fields: `_camelCase` with underscore prefix
- Public properties: `PascalCase`
- Serialized fields: `[SerializeField] private`
- Constants: Often as serialized fields for designer control

**Component References**:
- Cached in `Awake()` method
- Never use `GetComponent<>()` in Update/FixedUpdate
- Pattern: `private Rigidbody2D _rb; void Awake() { _rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>(); }`

**Unity Lifecycle**:
- `Awake()` - Initialize component references
- `Start()` - Initialize with other objects
- `FixedUpdate()` - Physics and Rigidbody movement
- `Update()` - Input and non-physics logic

### Project-Specific Patterns

**Input System**:
- Uses custom `InputManager` singleton
- Event-based input handling
- Subscribe in `OnEnable()`, unsubscribe in `OnDisable()`

**Animation**:
- Uses `SafeSetBool()`, `SafeSetFloat()`, etc. to prevent missing parameter errors
- Tracks missing parameters to avoid log spam

**Debug Visualization**:
- Heavy use of `OnDrawGizmos()` and `OnDrawGizmosSelected()`
- Debug panels with `OnGUI()` (often commented out for production)
- Toggle flags like `showJumpDebug`, `enableSlopeVisualization`

## Key Gameplay Systems

### Movement System (PlayerController)

**Features**:
- Variable jump height (Hollow Knight style)
- Coyote time (grace period after leaving ledge)
- Jump buffering (early jump input)
- Slope movement and detection
- Wall slide and wall stick (ability-gated)
- Dash and dash jump mechanics

**Important Details**:
- Movement in `FixedUpdate()` for physics
- Uses Rigidbody2D, not transform manipulation
- Multi-directional raycasts for slope detection
- Platform edge climbing assistance ("buffer climbing")

### Combat System (PlayerCombat)

**Features**:
- Ground attack combos
- Air attacks
- Dash attacks
- Attack hitbox detection with layers

**Patterns**:
- State tracking (IsAttacking, IsDashAttacking, IsAirAttacking)
- Attack buffering for combo fluidity
- Movement during attacks (reduced speed multiplier)

### Ability System

**Unlockable Abilities**:
- `HasDash` - Dash movement
- `HasDoubleJump` - Mid-air jump
- `HasWallStick` - Wall slide and stick
- `GetAbility("dashjump")` - Dash jump combo

**Integration**:
- All systems check `PlayerAbilities.Instance` before executing
- Abilities gate features, not remove code
- Example: Wall detection always runs, but stick/slide only with ability

## Common Gotchas

### 1. Wall Stick Behavior
- Complex logic with multiple raycasts (top, middle, bottom)
- Must have 2+ raycast hits for wall stick
- Wall stick disabled â†’ prevents all wall friction
- Recent fixes for corner sticking issues

### 2. Variable Jump Implementation
- Two methods: velocity clamping vs gravity reduction
- Compensation system for wall friction
- Separate min/max velocities for first jump vs double jump

### 3. Large PlayerController File
- 1,848 lines - consider refactoring when making major changes
- Many commented debug sections
- Historical fixes documented in comments

### 4. Layer System
- `Ground` layer - platforms and terrain
- `LandingBuffer` layer - platform edges for climbing
- Proper layer setup is critical for movement

### 5. Persistent Player
- Player uses `DontDestroyOnLoad()`
- Singleton pattern prevents duplicates across scenes
- Respawn system resets position, not GameObject

## Working with This Project

### Before Making Changes

1. **Check existing documentation** in `docs/` folder
2. **Review related systems** - components are tightly coupled
3. **Test with abilities enabled/disabled** - behavior changes significantly
4. **Consider debug visualization** - many systems have Gizmo helpers

### When Adding Features

1. **Follow existing patterns** - use serialized fields for config
2. **Add ability gates** if it's an unlockable feature
3. **Cache components** in Awake() if accessing other systems
4. **Add debug visualization** for spatial calculations
5. **Update relevant manager** (PlayerAbilities, InputManager, etc.)

### When Refactoring

1. **PlayerController is a candidate** - too large (1,848 LOC)
2. **Consider extracting**: Jump system, Wall interaction, Dash system
3. **Maintain serialized field structure** - designers rely on Inspector values
4. **Keep event subscription pattern** - OnEnable/OnDisable pairs

## Quick Reference Commands

When working on this project, common tasks:

**Understanding a system:**
"Explain how the [jump/dash/combat] system works in this project"

**Making changes:**
"Add [feature] following the existing patterns in this codebase"

**Debugging:**
"Why might wall stick behavior not work correctly?"

**Refactoring:**
"Help me extract the jump logic from PlayerController into a separate component"

**Remember**: This is an active development project. Systems are complex and interconnected. Always test changes with different ability combinations enabled/disabled.
