## Active Tests - Bug Prevention & Exploit Detection

### Air Attack Limit Tests (5 tests)

**Purpose:** Prevent infinite air attacks exploit and enforce 2-attack limit

1. ‚úÖ **AirAttack_LimitedToTwo_BeforeLanding**
   - **Verifies:** Player cannot use more than 2 air attacks before landing
   - **Catches:** Infinite air attack exploit via rapid clicking
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:98

2. ‚úÖ **AirAttack_IgnoresRapidClicks_DuringAnimation**
   - **Verifies:** Only ONE air attack registers despite button mashing
   - **Catches:** Rapid-click exploit creating overlapping attack states
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:152

3. ‚úÖ **DoubleJump_ForfeitsFirstSlot_WhenUnused**
   - **Verifies:** First air attack slot is forfeited if unused before double jump
   - **Catches:** Players getting 3 total attacks (1 before DJ + 2 after DJ)
   - **Design Rule:** Air attack slots separated by double jump
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:197

4. ‚úÖ **AirAttack_AllowsTwoTotal_WhenFirstSlotUsedBeforeDJ**
   - **Verifies:** Normal gameplay allows 2 attacks (1 before DJ + 1 after DJ)
   - **Catches:** First slot forfeiture logic breaking normal gameplay
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:243

5. ‚úÖ **Landing_ResetsAirAttackCounter_Always**
   - **Verifies:** Air attack counter resets to 0 on landing
   - **Catches:** Counter not resetting, preventing air attacks after landing
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:283

### Dash Attack Timing Tests (1 test)

6. ‚úÖ **DashAttack_AllowedInGracePeriod_AfterDashEnds**
   - **Verifies:** Dash attack can trigger within 0.2s after dash ends
   - **Catches:** Grace period timing check failures
   - **Window:** dashAttackInputWindow = 0.2s
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:338

### Attack State Machine Tests (2 tests)

7. ‚úÖ **Landing_ResetsAttackState_WhenTimerExpired**
   - **Verifies:** Attack state fully resets on landing when timer expired
   - **Catches:** Lingering attack states causing gameplay bugs
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:404

8. ‚úÖ **Landing_KeepsAttackActive_WhenTimerStillActive**
   - **Verifies:** Air attack counter resets even if animation continues
   - **Catches:** Counter not resetting when landing mid-attack
   - **Edge Case:** Player lands during air attack animation
   - **Location:** PlayerCombatTests.cs:428

## Ignored Tests - Require PlayMode or Mocking

‚è≠Ô∏è **DashAttack_Triggers_DuringDash**
- **Reason:** Requires Time.time advancement (0.1s pre-window)
- **Future:** Implement in PlayMode tests

‚è≠Ô∏è **DashAttack_Blocked_WhenOnWall**
- **Reason:** Requires PlayerController mock for wall state
- **Future:** Create PlayerController mock or PlayMode test

‚è≠Ô∏è **ComboAttack_LoopsAfterThirdHit**
- **Reason:** Requires PlayerController.IsGrounded for ground attacks
- **Future:** Create PlayerController mock or PlayMode test

‚è≠Ô∏è **InputBuffer_ExecutesOnce_ThenClears**
- **Reason:** Requires time simulation for buffer expiration
- **Future:** Implement in PlayMode tests

---

## Test Infrastructure

### Helper Classes Created

**PlayerTestHelper.cs**
- `SetupAirbornePlayer()` - Configure airborne state for tests
- `SetupGroundedPlayer()` - Configure grounded state for tests
- `SetupPlayerOnWall()` - Configure wall state for tests
- `UnlockAbility()` - Enable specific abilities
- `ResetAllAbilities()` - Reset all abilities to default
- `AssertExploitPrevented()` - Assert exploit prevention
- `AssertDesignRule()` - Assert game design rule enforcement

**CombatTestHelper.cs**
- `AdvanceTimeBy()` - Time simulation (placeholder for PlayMode)
- `AssertInputBuffered()` - Verify input buffering

### Test Initialization Methods Added

**PlayerCombat.cs**
```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR || UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS
public void InitializeForTesting(Rigidbody2D testRb, Animator testAnimator, PlayerController testController = null)
#endif
```

**PlayerAbilities.cs**
```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR || UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS
public void InitializeForTesting()
#endif
```

### Key Fixes Applied

1. **Null-safe PlayerController access** - Added null checks throughout PlayerCombat
2. **Singleton cleanup in TearDown** - Prevents test contamination
3. **EditMode Awake() workaround** - Manual singleton initialization for tests

## Code Coverage

### PlayerCombat.cs (706 lines)

**Tested:**
- ‚úÖ Air attack limit enforcement (`StartAirAttack()`, line 464-508)
- ‚úÖ Air attack slot forfeiture (`OnDoubleJump()`, line 352-367)
- ‚úÖ Landing state reset (`OnLanding()`, line 337-350)
- ‚úÖ Rapid-click protection (`StartAirAttack()` guards, line 468-472, 476-480)
- ‚úÖ Dash attack grace period (`HandleAttackInput()`, line 184-199)
- ‚úÖ Attack state cleanup (`ResetAttackSystem()`, line 577-652)

**Not Tested (requires PlayMode/mocking):**
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Combo attack sequencing (needs PlayerController.IsGrounded)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Dash attack during dash (needs Time.time simulation)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Wall state checks (needs PlayerController mock)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Input buffering execution (needs time simulation)

## Test Philosophy

These tests follow **behavior-driven testing** principles:

1. **Test BEHAVIOR, not implementation** - Verify observable outcomes
2. **Catch EXPLOITS first** - Focus on bug prevention over happy paths
3. **Document DESIGN RULES** - Tests encode game design decisions
4. **No "sloppy" tests** - Every test must reveal bugs or be ignored
5. **EditMode limitations acknowledged** - Ignore tests that can't run properly

---

## Next Steps

### Short Term
- ‚úÖ All critical air attack mechanics tested
- ‚úÖ Dash attack grace period verified
- ‚úÖ State machine cleanup tested

### Medium Term (Future Work)
- Create PlayerController mock for ground/wall state tests
- Implement PlayMode tests for timing-dependent behavior
- Add tests for PlayerMovement, PlayerGroundDetection, SimpleEnemy

### Long Term
- Target: 130-155 total tests across all player systems
- Achieve 80%+ code coverage for player mechanics
- Continuous integration with automated test runs
