## üìã Usage Guidelines

### When to Reference This Archive

**DO reference when:**
- Understanding why certain architectural decisions were made
- Looking for context on past refactoring efforts
- Researching features that were considered but not implemented
- Troubleshooting issues related to completed migrations
- Learning from past testing strategies

**DON'T use as:**
- Current implementation guides (use active docs in `/docs` root)
- Source of truth for current architecture
- Up-to-date feature documentation
- Current test counts or status

## üîç Finding Specific Information

### "Why did we choose this architecture?"
‚Üí See `migrations/EnemySystemMigrationGuide.md` and `migrations/Parameter_Migration_*` files

### "How were moving platforms implemented?"
‚Üí See `completed/MOVING_PLATFORMS_*.md` (setup process)
‚Üí For current guide: `../MOVING_PLATFORMS_GUIDE.md`

### "What features were considered but not added?"
‚Üí See `experimental/` folder (breakable terrain experiments)

### "How did the test suite evolve?"
‚Üí See `testing_history/` folder (planning and expansion)

### "What was the old feature tracking system?"
‚Üí See `feature_log.md` (legacy tracking, now use DevLog.md)
