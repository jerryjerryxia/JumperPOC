# Simple Composite Collider Breakable Setup

## The Problem (Fixed!)

The previous system was creating unnecessary colliders and not working with your existing composite collider setup. **This has been fixed with a simple, elegant solution.**

## How It Works Now

The system is now **dead simple**:

1. **Select ANY GameObject** you want to be breakable
2. **Add BreakableTerrain** component (via tool or manually)
3. **It automatically works** with whatever collider setup you have

## For Your Composite Collider Tilemap

### **Quick Setup:**

1. **Select the GameObject** that represents your breakable tile/area
2. **Open `Tools → Breakable Terrain Setup Helper`**
3. **Choose your configuration** (Secret Wall, Floor Collapse, etc.)
4. **Click "Add Breakable Terrain to Selected Objects"**

**That's it!** The system will:
- ✅ **Use existing colliders** if you have them
- ✅ **Create simple triggers** if needed
- ✅ **Detect composite colliders** automatically
- ✅ **Size triggers appropriately** based on sprites or default to 1x1
- ✅ **Handle tile removal** and composite regeneration

## What Changed

### **Before (Overcomplicated):**
- Created child objects
- Complex detection logic
- Tried to manage composite colliders
- Created colliders "out of thin air"

### **Now (Simple & Elegant):**
- **Works with your existing setup**
- **Uses whatever collider you already have**
- **Only adds minimal triggers when needed**
- **Automatically detects and handles composite colliders**
- **No unnecessary object creation**

## Example Usage

### **If you have a GameObject with a BoxCollider2D:**
```
GameObject: "SecretWall"
├─ BoxCollider2D (isTrigger: true)  ← System uses this
└─ BreakableTerrain ← Tool adds this
```

### **If you have a GameObject with CompositeCollider2D:**
```
GameObject: "TilemapWall" 
├─ CompositeCollider2D ← System detects this
├─ BoxCollider2D (isTrigger: true) ← System creates this for break detection
└─ BreakableTerrain ← Tool adds this
```

### **If you have a GameObject with no colliders:**
```
GameObject: "BreakableArea"
├─ BoxCollider2D (isTrigger: true) ← System creates this (sized to sprite or 1x1)
└─ BreakableTerrain ← Tool adds this
```

## The Result

**No matter what your setup is, it just works!**

- **Your composite collider** continues to handle ground collision efficiently
- **Simple trigger colliders** handle break detection
- **No interference** between the two systems
- **Automatic tile removal** and composite regeneration when needed

**Select your objects → Run the tool → Done!** 

The complexity is handled automatically behind the scenes.
